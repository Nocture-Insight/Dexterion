## VAC
Some considerations has taken into account when creating this game enhancer.\
We do as much as posible to avoid begin detected ( goal of the project ) and invisible from VAC detection.\
However, we declares heres, that we didnt studied in-depth of this system.\
I cannot 100% confirm that vac doesnt detect this but in this case the cheat should be undetected 100%.\
Something to be aware of is the Overwatch if you got any unussual activity you will get caught and banned.
